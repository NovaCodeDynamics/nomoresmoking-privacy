<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="muted">No More Smoking — Last updated: January 2026</p>
<hr/>

<p>
No More Smoking (“we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy.
This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it,
and the choices you have.
</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>Email Address</h3>
<p>
We collect your email address to create and authenticate your account,
provide essential app features (such as login and password recovery),
and respond to customer support requests.
</p>

<h3>Health Data</h3>
<p>
We collect user-provided health-related data such as smoking habits,
goals, progress, and milestones. This information is used solely to
provide core app functionality and progress tracking within the app.
</p>

<h3>Device Identifiers</h3>
<p>
We may collect device identifiers (such as Advertising ID) through
third-party advertising services in order to display advertisements,
measure ad performance, and prevent fraud.
</p>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Provide and maintain app functionality</li>
  <li>Store your progress and preferences</li>
  <li>Enable rewarded features and premium access</li>
  <li>Ensure app security, stability, and reliability</li>
  <li>Respond to customer support requests</li>
</ul>

<h2>Advertising & Tracking</h2>
<p>
No More Smoking uses third-party advertising services, such as Google AdMob,
to display ads within the app, including rewarded advertisements.
</p>

<p>
These services may collect device identifiers to provide personalized or
non-personalized ads, measure ad effectiveness, and prevent fraud.
</p>

<p>
Tracking is performed in accordance with Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT)
framework. Users are asked for permission before tracking is enabled.
If permission is not granted, tracking is disabled and only non-personalized
ads may be shown.
</p>

<p>
We do not use email addresses or health data for advertising or tracking purposes.
</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
We do not sell your personal data. We may share limited information with
trusted service providers (such as hosting, analytics, email delivery,
or advertising partners) strictly for operating and improving the app,
and only in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>
We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect
your information against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.
</p>

<h2>Your Choices</h2>
<p>
