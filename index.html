  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and maintain app functionality</li>
    <li>Store your progress and preferences</li>
    <li>Keep the app secure and reliable</li>
    <li>Respond to support requests</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tracking & Advertising</h2>
  <p>We do not use your email address or health data for tracking purposes, and we do not sell your personal data.</p>

  <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share your personal data with third parties for advertising or tracking. We may use service providers (such as hosting or email delivery) only to operate the app.</p>

  <h2>Advertising and Tracking</h2>
<p>
We use third-party advertising services, such as Google AdMob, to display ads within the app,
including rewarded advertisements. These services may collect device identifiers (such as
Advertising ID) to provide personalized or non-personalized ads, measure ad performance,
and prevent fraud.
</p>

<p>
Tracking is conducted in accordance with Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework.
Users are asked for permission before any tracking is enabled. If permission is not granted,
tracking is disabled and only non-personalized ads may be shown.
</p>

<p>
We do not collect or use device identifiers to personally identify users. Advertising and
tracking data is handled by third-party providers in accordance with their own privacy policies.
